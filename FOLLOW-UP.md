# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?

Only the bpk-component-button. If I had time I would try to re-use as many components
as possible from the style guide.

### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

(Default) `npm start`

---

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

- add prop-types for components (and any other fixes to make sure the linting passes).
- use a service method to get the flights.json so that in a test, this response can be mocked.
- add a test for the loading flights user interaction; check that on page load there are the expected number of Itinerary and Leg components rendered.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

- the design looks very close to that provided so I am quite happy with this.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

- mainly the naming conventions for components and BEM. I think this would be more succint with some more domain knowledge and familiarity.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

- the test was very enjoyable and no issues completing it, however I've been pushed for time as I have just returned from travels and I'm job hunting and flat hunting at the same time!
